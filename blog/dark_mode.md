I want to briefly highlight a cool new feature in D2, which is that you can set both a
light theme *and* a dark theme for diagrams in D2.

```
d2 --theme=0 --dark-theme=200 input.d2
```

How does this work? How can a diagram have two themes?

Try opening up your system preferences and toggling between light and dark mode.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: require('@site/static/blog/dark_mode/main.svg2')}}></div>

What you should have seen is the above diagram adapting to your preference. If you didn't
want to follow along, here's two PNGs of what it would've transitioned between:

<img src={require('@site/static/blog/dark_mode/permalight.png').default} alt="d2 cheat sheet" style={{width:'50%'}}/>
<img src={require('@site/static/blog/dark_mode/permadark.png').default} alt="d2 cheat sheet" style={{width:'50%'}}/>

This means that if your website already supports a responsive experience for visitors that
prefer light mode and dark mode, it takes zero extra work to include a D2 diagram that'll
adapt to light preferences. The alternative method used across the web currently is to
include two diagrams -- and toggle which one gets shown with media queries.

This is currently a new feature, and we are working on adding more themes and considering
including it by default.

How does this work? The diagram actually is a high level overview of it. All the shapes
and connections are color coded, which takes into account their depth, shape type, and a
few other factors. The themes then provide a color for that color code in CSS. Since
classes are secondary to attributes and styles, any explicitly set styles are not
overwritten. The dark mode theme simply applies a different set of colors to the color
codes with a media query.

Shoutout to first-time contributor

juggled commits in between high school exams to implement this &lt;3.
