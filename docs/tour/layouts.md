# Overview

D2 supports using a variety of different layout engines. The choice of layout engines can
significantly influence your overall diagram. Each layout also has varying degrees of
support for certain keywords. Though we try our best to keep things consistent, ultimately
we have the most control over our custom-built layout engine and are limited by what the
other layout engines support.

## Layout engines

- [dagre](/tour/dagre/) (default): A fast, directed graph layout engine that produces
  layered/hierarchical layouts. Based on Graphviz's DOT algorithm.
- [ELK](/tour/elk/): Also a directed graph layout engine. More mature than dagre, better
  maintained (part-time academic research team working on it), with recent releases.
- [TALA](/tour/tala/): New layout engine designed specifically for software architecture
  diagrams.

You can choose whichever layout engine you like and works best for the diagram you're
making. Each one has its tradeoffs, visit the individual pages to learn more.

To see available layouts on your machine, you can run `d2 layout`. Each layout engine can
also have specific configurable flags, which you can find by running `d2 layout [engine]`,
e.g. `d2 layout dagre`.

To specify the layout used, you can either set the flag `--layout=dagre` or set it as an
environment variable, `$D2_LAYOUT=dagre`.

### Layout-specific functionality

Some keywords and functionality are only available for certain layout engines. We authored
and maintain TALA, so it is the only one we have full control over. We write shims for
Dagre and ELK, but some things are fundamental to the layout engines, and the only way to
support everything we want to do on those is to fork (which we may eventually do).

These are mentioned in other parts of the doc and aggregated here:

- `near` set to another object. `near` can be set to constants for all layout engines, but
  only TALA can use it to set to objects.
- `width` and `height` on containers. TALA will add this soon, but currently it is only in
  ELK. Note that these keywords work on non-containers in all layout engines.
- `top` and `left` to lock positions only work in TALA.
- Connections from ancestors to descendants (e.g. a container to its child) do not work in
  Dagre.

## Direction

Set `direction` to one of the following to influence an explicit direction your diagram
flows towards.

:::info Options
- `up`
- `down`
- `right`
- `left`
:::

<CodeBlock className="language-d2">
    {DirectionRight}
</CodeBlock>

<div
className="embedSVG" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: require('@site/static/img/generated/direction-right.svg2')}}></div>

<CodeBlock className="language-d2">
    {DirectionUp}
</CodeBlock>

<div
className="embedSVG" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: require('@site/static/img/generated/direction-up.svg2')}}></div>

### Directions per container (TALA only)

:::info
Directions can only be set at a global level for all the layout engines except TALA. This
is a limitation of their algorithms, which are hierarchical and only work in one
direction. We are investigating ways to hack it to work.
:::

```d2
vars: {
  d2-config: {
    layout-engine: tala
  }
}
direction: down
a -> b -> c

b: {
  direction: right
  1 -> 2 -> 3
}

a: {
  direction: left
  foo -> bar
}
```
