# Exports

import WebPImage from '@site/src/components/WebPImage';

On the CLI, you may export `.d2` into
* [SVG](#svg)
* [PNG](#png)
* [PDF](#pdf)
* [PPTX](#pptx)
* [GIF](#gif)
* [Stdout](#stdout)

## SVG

```shell
d2 in.d2 out.svg
```

SVG is the default export format on the CLI. If you don't specify an output, the export
file will be the input name as an SVG file.

For example, `d2 in.d2` will produce a file named `in.svg`.

The resulting SVG has CSS injected into it. This, along with the use of HTML
`<foreignObject>`s used to make Markdown work, means that the SVG is meant to be viewed in
a web context. For example, opening it up in your browser, embedding it onto a webpage. It
may not look right without a web context, like in Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator.

On the CLI, if you pass in `-`
- for the input, it reads D2 from stdin
- for the output, it writes SVG to stdout

:::info Technical details on SVG exports This information might be useful if you're
planning on doing post-processing on the SVG exports.

**Element IDs**: All shape elements get CSS classes with base64-encoded IDs for safe CSS
targeting. For example, a shape with ID `my-shape` gets class `bXktc2hhcGU` (base64
encoding of "my-shape").

**Unique identifiers**: Each diagram gets a deterministic hash prefix (e.g.,
`d2-1234567890`) used for clip paths, gradients, and other SVG elements to prevent
conflicts when multiple diagrams are on the same page.

## PNG

```shell
d2 in.d2 out.png
```

PNG exports work by [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) spinning up a
headless browser, putting the SVG onto it, and taking a screenshot. The first invocation
of Playwright will download its dependencies, if they don't already exist on the machine.

:::info
If you get a message like `err: failed to launch Chromium`, you can try installing
Playwright dependencies outside of D2 on your machine. For example:

```
npm install -g @playwright
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

## PDF

```shell
d2 in.d2 out.pdf
```

PDF exports are the result of taking PNG exports and placing them on PDF pages, along with
headers and fonts. As such, dependencies needed for PNG exports are also needed for PDF
exports.

PDF is _more_ interactive than PNG, but _less_ interactive than SVG.

For example, `animate` keyword won't show up in PDF exports like they would in SVG.

But `link`s can still be clickable in PDFs.

<WebPImage src={require('@site/static/img/screenshots/linked_pdf.png').default} webpSrc={require('@site/static/img/screenshots/linked_pdf.webp').default} alt="linked PDF example in D2" width={500}/>

## PPTX

```shell
d2 in.d2 out.pptx
```

Similar to PDF exports. This export format is useful for giving presentations when used
with composition (e.g. diagram with multiple Layers, Scenarios, Steps).

## GIF

```shell
d2 in.d2 out.gif
```

This export format is useful for giving presentations when used with short compositions.
For example, show two Scenarios, show a couple of steps. Something that the audience can
digest in a loop that lasts a couple of seconds without needing to flip through it
manually.

## Stdout

D2 accepts `-` in place of the input and/or output arguments. SVG is used as the format
for Stdout output.

For example, this writes a D2 script of `x -> y` and outputs it to a file `example.svg`.

```shell
echo "x -> y" | d2 - - > example.svg
```
