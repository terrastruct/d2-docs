**[ðŸ”— Gallery](/examples/elk)**

ELK is a mature, hierarchical layout, actively maintained by an academic research group at
[Christian Albrechts University in
Kiel](https://www.rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/en/team).

## Reference

[https://www.eclipse.org/elk/reference.html](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/reference.html)

## Pros

- Clean, orthogonal routes.
- Highly customizable.
- Fast.
- Good at minimizing crossings.
- Natively supports container to container routing, handling these better than dagre.
- Undergoing active improvements with regular releases.
- Routes SQL tables with exact columns.

## Cons

- Strictly hierarchical, like dagre.
- Some routes have unnecessary bends.
- Minimal consideration for symmetry.
