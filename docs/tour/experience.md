# A diagramming dev tool

D2 is designed towards a single goal: **turn diagramming into a pleasant experience for
engineers**. Plenty of tools can claim to do that for simple diagrams, but you stop having
a good time as soon as you get to even slightly complex diagrams — the ones that most need
to exist.

Why is that? Because most diagramming tools today are design tools, not dev tools. They
give you a blank canvas and a drag-and-drop toolbar like you'd see on Figma or Photoshop,
and treat their intended workflow as a design process. Engineers are not visual designers,
and the lack of ability to spatially architect a system should not block the creation of
valuable documentation. Every drag and drop shouldn’t require planning, and updates
shouldn’t be a frustrating exercise in moving things around and resizing to make room for
the new piece. Declarative Diagramming removes that friction.
