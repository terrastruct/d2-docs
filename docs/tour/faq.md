# Frequently asked questions

## How does this compare to Mermaid, Graphviz, PlantUML?

We've created a website with detailed comparisons:
[https://text-to-diagram.com](https://text-to-diagram.com).

## Is this designed for small diagrams or complex ones?

Both. The syntax is kept minimal and unstructured to make small diagrams with as little lines as possible. At the same time, the language includes IDE features like an autoformatter, error messages, and comments to maintain large diagrams.

## What are the current shortcomings?

There are many features we don't have but are currently working on or have planned. For
those, you can take a look at our [roadmap](future.md).
