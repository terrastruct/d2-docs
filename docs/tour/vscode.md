# VSCode extension

D2 has an official, creator-maintained extension for VSCode. It's searchable and
downloadable through the VSCode marketplace for free.

Automatic indentation and syntax highlighting are fully supported and make working with
the D2 language far more pleasant. Split-screen diagramming within VSCode is planned.

The syntax highlighting will even catch basic errors for you if your color theme
highlights illegal syntax.
