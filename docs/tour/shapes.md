# Shapes

## Basics

You can declare shapes like so:

```d2
imAShape
im_a_shape
im a shape
i'm a shape
# notice that one-hyphen is not a connection
# whereas, `a--shape` would be a connection
a-shape
```

<div className="embedSVG" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: require('@site/static/img/generated/shapes-1.svg2')}}></div>

You can also use semicolons to define multiple shapes on the same line:

```d2
SQLite; Cassandra
```

By default, a shape's label is the same as the shape's key. But if you want it to be different, assign a new label like so:

```d2
pg: PostgreSQL
```

By default, a shape's type is `rectangle`. To specify otherwise, provide the field `shape`:

```d2
Cloud: my cloud
Cloud.shape: cloud
```

## Example

```d2
pg: PostgreSQL
Cloud: my cloud
Cloud.shape: cloud
SQLite; Cassandra
```

<div className="embedSVG" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: require('@site/static/img/generated/shapes-2.svg2')}}></div>

:::info
Keys are case-insensitive, so `postgresql` and `postgreSQL` will reference the same shape.
