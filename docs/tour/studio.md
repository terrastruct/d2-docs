# D2 Studio

import WebPImage from '@site/src/components/WebPImage';

[D2 Studio](https://terrastruct.com/d2-studio/) is to D2 as IntelliJ is to Java (or XCode is to Swift, or GoLand is to Go, etc).

D2 is a programming language, and you can write and run it anywhere -- the end result is the same. But the medium changes the experience. Writing D2 on a code editor beats writing it on Apple Notes. D2 Studio is the optimized, feature-packed IDE for D2, turning it into a professional, collaborative diagramming tool for the whole team.

D2 Studio is one of the ways the company behind D2 monetizes. It's free to try and
evaluate, and like other IDEs you might try for your code, you can easily onboard by
importing existing D2 code and offboard the same way. No lock-in.
