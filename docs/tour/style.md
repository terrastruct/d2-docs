# Styling objects

If you'd like to overwrite the style of a theme for a particular object, you may add styles to objects like so:

```d2
x: {
  style: {
    opacity: 0.6
    fill: orange
    stroke: "#53C0D8"
    stroke-width: 5
    shadow: true
  }
}

y: {
  style: {
    opacity: 0.6
    fill: red
    3d: true
  }
}
```

<img src={require('@site/static/img/screenshots/style_1.png').default} alt="styling example" width="500"/>

Here is the full list of styles you can configure. More coming soon, as well as classes so you can aggregate styles.
