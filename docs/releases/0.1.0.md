When we launched D2 to open-source 2 weeks ago, we left the sprint after it a completely blank slate. Because, while we do have long-term goals, we wanted to make the first post-launch update focused 100% on addressing the biggest pain points that came up. Thank you so much to everyone who asked for or complained about something. Every item in this release was something that was posted on the D2 Discord, a GitHub issue/discussion, a comment on social media, or an email.

On top of the listed changes to core D2, we have been building out integrations, starting with [Obsidian](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2-obsidian). Work has also begun on the API and Playground.

If you want a fast way to check out what a change looks like, we put screenshots in the PRs when it's a visual change.

#### Features üöÄ

- Windows support has landed! See [./docs/INSTALL.md](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/blob/v0.1.0/docs/INSTALL.md#windows) for usage instructions. [#96](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/96)

- Sequence diagrams are now supported, experimentally. See [docs](https://d2lang.com/tour/sequence-diagrams/). [#99](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/99)
- Formatting of d2 scripts is supported on the CLI with the `fmt` subcommand. See `man d2` or `d2 --help`. [#292](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/292)
- LaTeX is now supported. See [docs](https://d2lang.com/tour/text/) for how to use. [#229](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/229)
- `direction` keyword is now supported to specify `up`, `down`, `right`, `left` layouts. See [docs](https://d2lang.com/tour/layouts/) for more.
  [#251](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/251)
- Self-referencing connections are now valid. E.g. `x -> x`. Render will vary based on layout engine. [#273](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/273)
- Arrowhead labels are now supported. [#182](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/182)
- Support for `stroke-dash` on shapes. [#188](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/188)
- Support for `font-color` on shapes and connections. [#215](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/215)
- Support for `font-size` on shapes and connections. [#250](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/250)
- HTML IDs are now added in the SVG output. You can use this to query shapes and connections by ID post-render. [#218](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/218)
- `-b/--bundle` flag to `d2` bundles all image assets directly as base64 data urls. [#278](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/278)
- [install.sh](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/blob/v0.1.0/docs/INSTALL.md) now accepts `-d` as an alias for `--dry-run`. [#266](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/266)

#### Improvements üßπ

- Local images can now be used for values to the `icon` keyword, e.g. `icon: ./my_img.png`. [#146](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/146)
- Connection labels no longer overlap other connections. [#332](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/332)
- ELK layout engine now defaults to top-down to be consistent with dagre. [#251](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/251)
- Container default font styling is no longer bold. Everything used to look too bold. [#358](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/358)
- `BROWSER=0` will disable opening a browser on `--watch`. [#311](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/311)
- [install.sh](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/blob/v0.1.0/docs/INSTALL.md) prints the dry run message more visibly. [#266](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/266)
- `d2` now lives in the root folder of the repository instead of as a subcommand. So you can now run `go install oss.terrastruct.com/d2@latest` to install from source. [#290](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/290)
- `install.sh` defaults to installation to `/usr/local` as before but now if `/usr/local` is not accessible to the current user, it will use `~/.local` instead of prompting for sudo. You can pass `--prefix /usr/local` to force installation into `/usr/local` with a prompt for sudo. [#372](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/372)

#### Bugfixes ‚õëÔ∏è

- 3D style was missing border and other styles for its top and right faces. [#187](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/187)

- No longer log benign file-watching errors. [#293](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/293)

- Fixes numbered IDs being wrongly positioned in `dagre` [#321](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/321).
