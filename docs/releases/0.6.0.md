D2 v0.6 introduces variable substitutions and globs. These two were the last of the features planned in the initial designs for D2, and v1 is now very close!

The power of variables and globs in a programming language need no introduction, so here's two minimal examples to get started:

**Variables**:
```d2
vars: {
  color: aquamarine
}

x.style.fill: ${color}
```

**Globs**:
```d2
x
y
z

*.style.fill: aquamarine
```

Both are live on [D2 Playground](https://play.d2lang.com) so give it a try! Looking forward to your issues and iterating

Layout capability also takes a subtle but important step forward: you can now customize the position of labels and icons.

#### Features üöÄ

- Variables and substitutions are implemented. See [docs](https://d2lang.com/tour/vars/). [#1473](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/1473)
